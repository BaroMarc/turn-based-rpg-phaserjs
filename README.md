# Turn-based RPG made with PhaserJS

This is a simple turn-based RPG HTML5 game made with [PhaserJS](http://phaser.io/). I made it following [Renan Oliveira's tutorial on gamedevacademy.org](https://gamedevacademy.org/phaser-rpg-tutorial), with a few modifications and improvements of my own.

This project uses ES2015 syntax, transpiled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and compressed with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), using **Webpack Dev Server** and **BrowserSync** for the development environment, made possible by the excellent [ES6-webpack template for PhaserJS](https://github.com/lean/phaser-es6-webpack) by [Leandro Cabrera](https://github.com/lean).
